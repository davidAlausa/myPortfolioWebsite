            I'm David, a graduate software developer with a love for all things code - 
            backend, frontend, data visualisation, and machine learning. I'd like to  
            think of myself as a jack of all trades, master of simplification and a  
            devoted "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" troubleshooter.

            Welcome to my website - <strong>100%</strong> coded by yours truly. Browse
            if you like, or just pretend you did. Either way works.
